# IDEA
It scrapes up latest blog posts from https://blog.coinbase.com/latest and rings a funni bruh alarm whenever they post any update.(I am a true retard)<br/>
Made this for a Trader Chigga on Discord.<br/>
I've used requests and bs4(beautiful soup) for the main scraping and playsound library to ring the funni bruh alarm.<br/>

# INSTALLATION
```
pip install requests<br/>
pip install bs4<br/>
pip install playsound<br/>
```
